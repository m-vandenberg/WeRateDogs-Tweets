The second piece was a tsv file hosted on servers which needed to be programmatically downloaded using pythons request library. The tsv file contained the top three image predictions for the breed of dog shown in the tweet. The third piece of data was gathered by querying Twitter’s API named Tweepy. Using the tweet ids and Tweepy the retweet count and favorite count was gathered for each tweet in the csv archive."

And programmatically with pandas to determine 8 or more quality issues and 2 or more tidiness issues. The following quality issues were detected: missing values, erroneous data types and wrong data. The following tidiness issues were detected: each variable didn’t form a column and each observational unit didn’t form a table.  "

Cleaning was performed on the copied data pieces and consisted of removing some row entries and columns, converting wrong data types, merging pieces of data and determining the correct values. The cleaning process resulted in a tidy master dataset which was stored in a csv file."
